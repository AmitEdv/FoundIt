    <h3>And lastly..</h3>
    <h4>If you lose your item (which we hope you won't...), someone might find your item with it's QR tag on it. The finder will scan the QR and will be transfered to our website and will be able to leave you a message and you'll be sent an email.</h4>
    <h4>Pretty simple... isn't it?</h4>
